/*
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m
nums2.length == n
0 <= m <= 1000
0 <= n <= 1000
1 <= m + n <= 2000
-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106


1) Find the length of the smaller arrays of the two. We will perform binary search on the smaller array.

2) For binary search, we will have two pointers - start = 0 and end = m (assuming m is the smaller length).

3) Loop until start meets end i.e., while (start <= end) { ... }.

4) Calculate the partition index (partitionA) for a which is the mid-point of start and end i.e., (start + end) / 2.

5) Calculate the partition index (partitionB) for b which is (m + n + 1) / 2 - partitionA.

6) Find the maximum element in the left of a and b and minimum element in the right of a and b.

7) Now, we can have three cases -
(i) If (maxLeftA <= minRightB && maxLeftB <= minRightA), then we have hit the jackpot ðŸ’°. Now, we can return the median based on (m + n) is even or odd.

(ii) Else If (maxLeftA > minRightB), it means, we are too far on the right and we need to go on the left, so, set end = partitionA - 1.

(iii) Else, we are too far on the left and we need to go to the right, so, set start = partitionA + 1.
